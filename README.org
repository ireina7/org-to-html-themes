Org-mode to HTML themes

** Getting started
This is my personal org-html themes repo, to use this repo, simply include the following lines in your =org= file:
#+BEGIN_SRC
#+SETUPFILE: https://ireina7.github.io/org-to-html-themes/org/theme-blog.setup
#+END_SRC
or if you want to use local setup files to get better performance, download this repo and include the setup file.

- note: You have to put your =HTML= file in the same location where the =org= and =src= directory lies.

** Examples
- The =README= [[https://ireina7.github.io/org-to-html-themes/README.html][file]] itself.
- Go to [[https://ireina7.github.io/org-to-html-themes/example.html][example page]] to see an blog example.

** Options
You can use =#+BEGIN_EXPORT .. #+END_EXPORT= to customize your own org template.

For more details, please refer to =doc/=.
